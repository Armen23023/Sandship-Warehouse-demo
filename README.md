# Sandship-Warehouse-demo


In Sandship, the warehouse is a place where players can store their materials. Itâ€™s like an inventory. 
Players can have multiple warehouses, and each warehouse has a list of materials and their quantities.

Materials can be added to the warehouse, or removed from it. Materials can also be moved from one warehouse to another as one transaction.
